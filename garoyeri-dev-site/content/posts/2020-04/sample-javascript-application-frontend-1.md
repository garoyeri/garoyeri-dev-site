  This series of posts describes how you can build up a simple web application hosted on Google Cloud to allow users to store extra information about locations on a map. It's meant for people who are just getting into JavaScript and have at least basic knowledge of how it works. When there's a more advanced concept, I'll try to explain it a bit more fully. The goal is to have a simple application that you can build and host that you can think of as a "real" application.

## Overview ##

In the last segment, we setup an initial empty Firebase application and got environment working. Now we'll add a new frontend to the application to show a simple map view and let us search for our current location and other useful things.

If you're just seeing this, you should start with the first article in the series instead: [Sample JavaScript Application Introduction](sample-javascript-application-introduction).

These instructions will walk through updating the frontend to add a free map control and have it do some searching for us.

## Looking at our Project in Visual Studio Code ##

At the end of the previous article if you were following along, you would've launched Visual Studio Code to see the project folder. If you launch Visual Studio Code right now, you should either see that same folder, or you may need to find it in your recent items.

Once we have the folder open in Visual Studio Code, we can easily get to the terminal from within here, and we can manipulate the HTML files. Since this may be your first time using Visual Studio Code, we can do a quick tour.

On the left side, you'll see some icons that represent which left-side pane to show.

Your icons may look different from mine (I'm using a "Dark" mode theme and I have a few more extensions installed that add extra functionality to the environment).

The first icon is for your "Explorer" which shows the files that are available in your project.

The second icon (the magnifying glass) is a "Search" function that lets you search for words across all your files.

The third icon is for Source Control (Git specifically) which lets you save your work.

The rest you can read on your own through the [Visual Studio Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

## Adding Maps to the Frontend ##

Finally, we'll be adding a Map to the application. Make sure the "Explorer" pane is open (click on the first icon at the top left in Visual Studio Code), then expand the `public` folder by clicking on it, then double-click `index.html`.

You'll see the template that was generated by Firebase. We need to get rid of the Firebase message and add our Map instead. You can find the new map code here:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/garoyeri/54bbc513c21372e2002ece959d578ff1.js"></script>

The comments are posted within the code, and we'll talk about a few key sections. But for now, copy the whole contents, delete everything in your `index.html` and replace it with this file. Then save your changes.

In the Terminal view, run:

```sh
firebase serve
```

And navigate to: http://localhost:5000 to see the result.

This example uses a few useful libraries:

1. [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/): an open source mapping library that can use many different available mapping data sources ([BSD-2 License](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE))
2. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/): open source map data that's available for fair use, attribution is required ([Open Data Commons Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/))

Open source libraries are freely available for just about any function you can imagine, however, you need to be careful of the license under which the software is offered. When in doubt, consult a legal professional (I'm not one). You can find a lot more information here: [Software Licenses in Plain English](https://tldrlegal.com/).

You can also deploy this to your Firebase account:

```sh
firebase deploy
```

and it will be accessible using your Firebase web address. For example: https://sample-map-application-ac028.web.app/
