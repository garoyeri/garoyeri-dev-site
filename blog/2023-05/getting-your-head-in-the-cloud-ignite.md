## DevOpsDays Austin 2023

I recently gave an "Ignite" talk at DevOpsDays Austin 2023 (in Austin) about a mental model for the cloud to build a foundation of knowledge for you to better understand cloud technology as a whole. An "Ignite" talk is a 5 minute talk where you present 20 slides, each advancing at 15 seconds, without stopping until the end. The challenge is to distill your message such that it can be presented in 5 minutes. It's a fun, but challenging, format that really makes you edit, edit, and edit some more.

## Kansas City Developers Conference

I'll be presenting a much longer form version of this talk at [KCDC (Kansas City Developers Conference)](https://www.kcdc.info/sessions) in June! In this extended format, I'll go into many more examples and be my usual, highly interactive self. It's an amazing conference with a big audience and a ton of incredible sessions. If you don't have immovable plans, you should get your tickets and plan to be in Kansas City for their Developer Conference.

## Ignite Talk Deck

I've posted the deck for the Ignite talk here in case you're interested: [Garo Yeriazarian - Getting your head in the cloud by getting your head in the cloud - Ignite Austin DevOps Days 2023](getting-your-head-in-the-cloud-ignite.assets/Garo%20Yeriazarian%20-%20Getting%20your%20head%20in%20the%20cloud%20by%20getting%20your%20head%20in%20the%20cloud%20-%20Ignite%20Austin%20DevOps%20Days%202023.pdf).
